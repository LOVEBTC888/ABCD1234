It should look exactly the same, but it will take up much less space. Also a number of inconsistencies in the way classes are applied has been fixed. If you are just using the library to output standard notation, you probably won&#39;t notice any difference. However, if you are querying the SVG directly, or setting CSS that targets elements, then you will need to retest.</p><p>There has been a change to the data that comes back from the click listener. This includes information if the user has dragged a note.</p><p>There are some minor improvements to the spacing of elements. That may slightly change how the music is laid out.</p><p>There have been many improvements to the audio quality. More improvements are coming, too!</p><h2 id="notes-for-version-5-9-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notes-for-version-5-9-0" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notes for Version 5.9.0</h2><p>This is a beta version of the new synth method.

This has made the minimized package 90K smaller, and has increased the speed of generating the SVG image by about 6 times!</li></ul><p>For the most common use of creating either the sheet music or the audio, there isn&#39;t any change.</p><p>However, if you use the animation callback in the audio to manipulate the notes, then be aware that, instead of receiving elements that are wrapped in a Raphael object, you now receive the actual SVG element. For the most common example of the animation functionality, the following was recommended to change the color of notes:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>element.attr({ fill: color });
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>That should be changed to:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>element.setAttribute(&quot;fill&quot;, color);
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><ul><li>If you do specific manipulation of the SVG, you will need to retest your code.
